# ScholarBot

Currently just a little project to display paper information, link researcher accounts with verification, and record / notify upcoming events.

Only has some doi support currently, though I plan on updating it more in the future. Probably add support for slack and zoom too along with discord.

## Current Requirements

Using Node 19.8.1
Using npm 9.5.1

## Environment File (.env)

```
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<discord_client_id>
DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord_token>
```
